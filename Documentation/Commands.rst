Commands
========

Commands are the basic value objects, or models, that represent write
operations that you can perform in your domain.

As an example, one might implement create this command for updating user
passwords.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class UserUpdatePasswordCommand : Command<UserAggregate, UserId>
    {
      public Password NewPassword { get; }
      public Password OldPassword { get; }

      public UserUpdatePasswordCommand(
        UserId id,
        Password newPassword,
        Password oldPassword)
        : base(id)
      {
        Username = username;
        Password = password;
      }
    }

Note that the ``Password`` class is merely a value object created to
hold the password and do basic validation. Read the article regarding
:ref:`value objects <value-objects>` for more information. Also, you
don't have to use the default EventFlow ``Command<,>`` implementation,
you can create your own, it merely have to implement the ``ICommand<,>``
interface.

A command by itself doesn't do anything and will throw an exception if
published. To make a command work, you need to implement one (and only
one) command handler which is responsible for invoking the aggregate.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class UserUpdatePasswordCommandHandler :
      CommandHandler<UserAggregate, UserId, UserUpdatePasswordCommand>
    {
      public override Task ExecuteAsync(
        UserAggregate aggregate,
        UserUpdatePasswordCommand command,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      {
        aggregate.UpdatePassword(
          command.OldPassword,
          command.NewPassword);

        return Task.FromResult(0);
      }
    }

Ensure idempotency
------------------

Detecting duplicate operations can be hard, especially if you have a
distributed application, or simply a web application. Consider the
following simplified scenario.

1. The user wants to change his password
2. The user fills in the "change password form"
3. As user is impatient, or by accident, the user submits the for twice
4. The first web request completes and the password is changed. However,
   as the browser is waiting on the first web request, this result is
   ignored
5. The second web request throws a domain error as the "old password"
   doesn't match as the current password has already been changed
6. The user is presented with a error on the web page

Handling this is simple, merely ensure that the aggregate is idempotent
is regards to password changes. But instead of implementing this
yourself, EventFlow has support for it and its simple to utilize and is
done per command.

To use the functionality, merely ensure that commands that represent the
same operation has the same ``ISourceId`` which implements ``IIdentity``
like the example blow.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class UserUpdatePasswordCommand : Command<UserAggregate, UserId>
    {
      public Password NewPassword { get; }
      public Password OldPassword { get; }

      public UserCreateCommand(
        UserId id,
        ISourceId sourceId,
        Password newPassword,
        Password oldPassword)
        : base(id, sourceId)
      {
        Username = username;
        Password = password;
      }
    }

Note the use of the other ``protected`` constructor of ``Command<,>``
that takes a ``ISourceId`` in addition to the aggregate root identity.

If a duplicate command is detected, a ``DuplicateOperationException`` is
thrown. The application could then ignore the exception or report the
problem to the end user.

The default ``ISourceId`` history size of the aggregate root, is ten.
But it can be configured using the ``SetSourceIdHistory(...)`` that must
be called from within the aggregate root constructor.

Easier ISourceId calculation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ensuring the correct calculation of the command ``ISourceId`` can be
somewhat cumbersome, which is why EventFlow provides another base
command you can use, the ``DistinctCommand<,>``. By using the
``DistinctCommand<,>`` you merely have to implement the
``GetSourceIdComponents()`` and providing the ``IEnumerable<byte[]>``
that makes the command unique. The bytes is used to create a
deterministic GUID to be used as an ``ISourceId``.

.. code-block:: c#

    public class UserUpdatePasswordCommand :
      DistinctCommand<UserAggregate, UserId>
    {
      public Password NewPassword { get; }
      public Password OldPassword { get; }

      public UserUpdatePasswordCommand(
        UserId id,
        Password newPassword,
        Password oldPassword)
        : base(id)
      {
        Username = username;
        Password = password;
      }

      protected override IEnumerable<byte[]> GetSourceIdComponents()
      {
        yield return NewPassword.GetBytes();
        yield return OldPassword.GetBytes();
      }
    }

The ``GetBytes()`` merely returns the ``Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(...)`` of
the password.

.. CAUTION::

    Don't use the ``GetHashCode()``, as the implementation
    is different for e.g. ``string`` on 32 bit and 64 bit .NET.
